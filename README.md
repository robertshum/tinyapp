# TinyApp Project ðŸ’»

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Description

Users can create accounts to create/delete/edit shortened URL links.  Do note, there isn't a DB in the backend.  That portion is mocked in the server (all data is lost in a shutdown/restart).

## Branches

* Main - demo ready

* feature/cookies - allows setting and getting public (unsecured cookies).  Main version uses secured sessions.

* feature/user-registration - creation of new users and storage inside mock DB.

## Final Product

* The Url Page:
