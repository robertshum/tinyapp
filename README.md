# TinyApp Project ðŸ’»

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Description

Users can create accounts to create/delete/edit shortened URL links.  Do note, there isn't a DB in the backend.  That portion is mocked in the server (all data is lost in a shutdown/restart).

Finished Stretch Goals:

* Used method override so express can intercept PUT and DELETE endpoints from form POST.
```js
app.delete(...)
app.put(...)
```
* Analytics that track the # of times a link has been redirected, as well as a record of the timestamps.

Unfinished Stretch Goals:

* Keep track of how many UNIQUE visitors visit each url (using cookie sessions).

## Branches

* Main - demo ready.

* feature/cookies - allows setting and getting public (unsecured cookies).  Main version uses secured sessions.

* feature/user-registration - creation of new users and storage inside mock DB.

* feature/analytics - allows links to show how many times it has been redirected, and timestamp records of each redirect.

## Final Product

* The Url Page:
